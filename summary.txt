My name is Manoj Rashinkar. I'm an AI Solutions Engineer and Python enthusiast with a strong foundation in software engineering and data science. I'm originally from India and passionate about building intelligent, real-world AI solutions that make life easier.
Outside of tech, I have a big sweet tooth — I enjoy desserts way more than spicy food. My favorites include misal (on the milder side) and anything with paneer. Paneer butter masala and a good slice of cake? That’s a perfect meal.
